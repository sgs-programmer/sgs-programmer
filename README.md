Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm **Saleh Al-Hauthari**, a passionate **Computer Science student** and **developer** who loves exploring technology, cybersecurity, and software engineering.

Over the past few years, I've been deeply interested in how systems work â€” from **hardware** to **software**, and how security and performance come together to build reliable solutions. My main focus areas are **Cybersecurity**, **Web Development**, and **Programming Languages** like C++, Java, and SQL.

I'm continuously expanding my skills through hands-on projects, open-source contributions, and exploring how technology can make life smarter and safer. I enjoy learning new tools, experimenting with Linux systems, and understanding the inner workings of computers.
